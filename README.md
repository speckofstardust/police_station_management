# Police Record Management System
This project is concerned with creating a database management system that would be in use by police stations for purposes such as storing the information of their employees, visitors, cases and such, as well as to provide a convenient hassle-free way to view and update the system by authorised users. It should also allow civilians to register complaints with their respective police stations and check fines online.

## General Info
This project was done for a third-year DBMS group assignment for which the problem statement was: create a stand-alone or web-based application that uses five or more tables and has at least one stored procedure and one trigger. The allowed choices for front-end languages were between Java, C#, PHP and Python, while for back-end tool the choices were between SQL Server, MySQL and Oracle.


## Technologies
This project was made using Python (in particular, the Flask web framework), HTML, MySQL Server and MySQL Connector/Python.


## Setup
To install MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

MySQL Connector and Flask can both be installed using pip.

Database login details have to be changed in app.py for making the connection to the right database.
